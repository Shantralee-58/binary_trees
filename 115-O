 * Description: Average time complexities of operations on a Binary Search Tree (BST).
 */

/*
 * Inserting the value n:
 * Time complexity: O(log n) on average.
 * Explanation: The average time complexity for inserting a value in a BST is logarithmic.
 */

/*
 * Removing the node with the value n:
 * Time complexity: O(log n) on average.
 * Explanation: Similar to insertion, the average time complexity for removing a node in a BST is O(log n).

/*
 * Searching for a node in a BST of size n:
 * Time complexity: O(log n) on average.
 * Explanation: The average time complexity for searching in a balanced BST is logarithmic.
 *              However, in the worst-case scenario (unbalanced tree), the search complexity might degrade to O(n).
