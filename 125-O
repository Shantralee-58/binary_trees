/*
 * Average time complexities of operations on an AVL Tree.
 */

/*
 * Inserting the value n:
 * Average Time Complexity: O(log n)
 * Explanation: In AVL trees, insertion maintains balance through rotations, resulting in an average time complexity of O(log n).
 */

/*
 * Removing the node with the value n:
 * Average Time Complexity: O(log n)
 * Explanation: Similar to insertion, removal in AVL trees involves balancing, leading to an average time complexity of O(log n).

/*
 * Searching for a node in an AVL tree of size n:
 * Average Time Complexity: O(log n)
 * Explanation: Searching in AVL trees is efficient due to their balanced nature, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n).
